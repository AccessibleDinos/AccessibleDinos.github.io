There is a wide rectangle consisting of six comic panels stacked into two rows of three.TOP LEFT PANEL:There is a title in bold and all-caps centered at the top of the panel saying, “THE TOP FIVE EMOTIONS”.The green T-REX, viewed from the waist up, is talking.T-REX: 1) Happiness!TOP MIDDLE PANEL:We focus on T-REX’s face, as his mouth is open wider.T-REX: 2) Happiness, but with just a touch of melancholia!TOP RIGHT PANEL:The T-REX is stomping on a very small log cabin, which has a blue car outside of it. There is a yellow DROMICEIOMIMUS on the right edge of the panel, looking behind herself to see T-REX.T-REX: 3) Megahappiness!DROMICEIOMIMUS: Wait, why isn’t that #1?T-REX: It’s a sometimes treat. If megahappiness was as common as happiness, then we’d have to rename it to “happiness” and the original “happiness” would, according to the standard metric prefixes, become “micro-happiness”.DROMICEIOMIMUS: Fair enough!BOTTOM LEFT PANEL:T-REX is facing the left edge of the panel, stomping on a small woman. Behind him is an orange UTAHRAPTOR with his mouth open wide.T-REX: 4) The feeling you get by putting your hands into a big bag of rice!UTAHRAPTOR: Ooh, that one’s solid!BOTTOM MIDDLE PANEL:T-REX is on the left side of the panel, his head turned to face UTAHRAPTOR, who is on the right side of the panel, facing T-REX.T-REX: That last one but, with a non-Neutonian fluid instead.UTAHRAPTOR: And that one’s solid only under sufficient force! Well, buddy, your list is great and I have no criticisms for you. How about you and I both enjoy some Emotion #1 right now?BOTTOM RIGHT PANEL:There is a title in bold and all-caps in the top left of the panel, saying “BUT SOON:”T-REX whole body is seen, his arms are up, and his feet are pointed in towards themselves. His mouth is open very wide.T-REX: Oh no! I got a bit of Emotion #2 in me too!!T-REX: *LONG DRAMATIC SIGH*Copyright Ryan North 2018Original Site: www.qwantz.com
