          Hello my name is Ryan North and this is my comic, and it is called Dinosaur Comics! I hope you think it's pretty okay!
        </p>
        <p>
            Dinosaur Comics is a comic about talking dinosaurs! It appears online and also in print in some newspapers and magazines! There is an <a href="http://www.rsspect.com/rss/qwantz.xml">RSS feed</a> and a <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/dinosaurcomics/">LiveJournal feed</a> and a <a href="http://www.twitter.com/dinosaurcomics">Twitter feed</a> for the comics. If you want to learn more there is always the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dinosaur_Comics">Dinosaur Comics Wikipedia entry</a>, filled to the brim with wild half-truths and innuendo. If you wnat to support the comic, <a href="http://www.topatoco.com/qwantz/">maybe buy the book or some sweet merchandise</a>? They're awesome I PROMISE.
        </p>
        <p>
          My name is Ryan North and I make the comic! I am a dude living in Toronto, Canada, and making Dinosaur Comics is my job. It is basically the best job ever. You can <a href="mailto:ryan@qwantz.com">email me</a> if you want! You can <a href="http://ryannorth.tumblr.com/">read my journal</a> if you want! You can <a href="http://twitter.com/ryanqnorth">follow me on Twitter</a> if you want! What I am saying is that there are <em>options</em>. Hey, I've got <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ryan_North">a Wikipedia entry too</a>! I look like this:

        <p>
          Besides Dinosaur Comics, I co-edited <a href="http://tinyurl.com/machineodeath">Machine of Death</a>, a collection of stories based on <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=675">this Dinosaur Comic</a>! It went all the way to #1 on Amazon's bestseller list, which is basically amazing. <a href="http://www.machineofdeath.net/">It's a pretty good book!</a>
        </p>
        <p>
          They're fun! They're super fun when new questions are asked. If you'd like to interview me, drop me a line and if I'm not too busy we can work something out! If you'd like to read some, here are some older ones that I like and that go into some detail!

          Hey I just noticed that in each of those interviews I have different hairstyles! I am as unpredictable as a summer's rain, and just as sweet.

          Qwantz.com is where I put these dinosaur comics! You can also read them at other addresses if you want, like for instance <a href="http://www.dinosaurcomics.com/">dinosaurcomics.com</a> or <a href="http://www.exotica.ca/">exotica.ca</a> or <a href="http://www.chewbac.ca/">chewbac.ca</a>. Qwantz.com is a pretty good address though because it is very easy to spell and remember.
        </p>

          Man, comics are meant for sharing! TOTALLY GO FOR IT. You don't need permission to post the comics on your site or anything like that. If you want to print Dinosaur Comics in your not-for-profit magazine or newspaper (msot campus newspapers are like this), that too is totally fine and I'm not going to ask for money. I only ask that you drop me a line so I get to know about it and feel good, if just for one brief shining moment! If you want to print Dinosaur Comcis in a for-profit paper then drop me a line and we can talk.
        </p>
        <p>
          Oh my goodness I get so much email. It's at the point now where I can't respond to it all, but I do read every one. I'm sorry! If you contact me and need a response and don't get one, feel free to poke me again.
        </p>
        <p>
          This can be tricky! You want to be friendly, but you don't want to come on too strong. My best advice is to carefully observe others, and to relax!

        <p>
          Hi, I'm Brian! It is my goal, beginning with Ryan North's amazing web comic <em>Dinosaur Comics</em> to try creating accessible versions of web comics. The idea is to make it so that what is normally thought to be a purely visual medium (i.e., comics) is accessible to everyone, so that nobody has to miss out on these awesome things.
        </p>
        <p>
          Please note, though, that I have created this for a school project, and I do not have any affiliation with Ryan North or his website. My focus here is on transcribing and adapting existing content into an accessible format, and I therefore cannot (and should not) take any credit for the actual creation of the comics.
